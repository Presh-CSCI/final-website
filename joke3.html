  <h1>The Divorce Lawyer</h1>
  <p>A man enters a divorce lawyer's office, glancing around the sleek, polished space. After a moment, he asked, "How much do you charge?"</p>
  <p>The lawyer leans back in his chair, a wry smile forming on his lips. "It's a thousand dollars for three questions."</p>
  <p>The man's eyes widen. "Isn't that a bit steep?"</p>
  <p>The lawyer chuckles softly and retorts, "Yes, it is. Now, what's your third question?"</p>
