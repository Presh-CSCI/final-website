  <h1>The Lie Detector</h1>
  <p>A father purchases a lie detector robot that slaps people when they lie and decides to put it to the test during dinner.</p>
  <p>"Son," he asks, "where were you today?" The son replies, "At school, Dad." The robot promptly slaps the son. "Alright, I was at my friend's house watching a DVD!" the son corrects himself. The father inquires, "What DVD?" The son responds, "Kung Fu Panda." Once again, the robot slaps the son. "Fine, it was an adult film!" the son finally admits.</p>
  <p>Shocked, the father exclaims, "What? At your age, I didn't even know what an adult film was!" The robot slaps the father.</p>
  <p>The mother bursts into laughter, saying, "He is definitely your son!" To this, the robot slaps the mother as well.</p>
