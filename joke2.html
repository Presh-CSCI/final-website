  <h1>The Optimistic Son</h1>
  <p>One sunny afternoon, a father decided to teach his young son about the danger of alcohol. He set up a little experiment to illustrate his point. He took two worms and placed one in a glass of crystal-clear water and the other in a glass filled with whiskey.</p>
  <p>As the minutes passed, the worm in the water wriggled happily, thriving in its refreshing environment. Meanwhile, the poor worm in the whiskey struggled, curled up, and eventually died.</p>
  <p>Turning to his son, the father asked, “What did you learn from this?”</p> 
  <p>The boy thought for a moment before replying with a grin, “It tells me that if you drink alcohol, you won’t have to worry about worms!”</p>
